# IncidentAnalysisReport

Imagine you received an urgent call from Cloud Services, a mid-sized technology company. They noticed some unusual network activity and suspected there may have been unauthorized access to their systems. The mission is to dive into their log files and uncover what's really going on.


Deliverables: A comprehensive final report (1500-2000 words) detailing your complete analysis, findings, and recommendations.
An updated, detailed timeline of the incident.



Through my log analysis, i've told the story of what happened at Cloud Services, backed by evidence and insight. This was supposed to be a simulation of something a real-world cybersecurity professional might do.
